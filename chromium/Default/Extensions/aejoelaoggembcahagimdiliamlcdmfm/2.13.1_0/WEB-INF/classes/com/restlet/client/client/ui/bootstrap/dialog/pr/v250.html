<p class="whats-new-intro">June 26, 2017 - Restlet Client 2.5.0</p>
<h4>A shiny new request editor ✨</h4>
<div>
  <p>
    Request editing is at the very core of Restlet Client. Based on your feedback, we’ve enhanced the request
    editor.
    You’ll find nice goodies such as the ability to resize and collapse the headers and body.
    This new request editor is available for both Requests and Scenarios tabs. We hope you’ll find it handy and
    don't
    hesitate to let us know what you think.

<p class="whats-new-intro" style="margin-top: 20px;">June 26, 2017 - Restlet Client 2.5.0</p>
<h4>New testing capabilities</h4>
<div>
  <p>
    We’ve packed this release with nice additions regarding API testing:
  </p>
  <h5>
    Easily debug your scenarios
  </h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
    While crafting a scenario it can be helpful to see the preview of what your request will look like once it's
    sent.
    The new Request Preview panel displays an evaluated view of your request straight away.
  </p>
  <h5>Wait for success before moving on</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
    Sometimes in your scenarios you know that some of your requests may fail due to some delay, e.g. an asynchronous
    task on your back-end could take a few seconds to complete but the completion of that task is a prerequisite for
    the next request. Restlet Client now offers a way to retry a request up to 9 times with a configurable interval
    until assertions pass.
  </p>
  <h5>Configurable proxy for the test runner</h5>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
    We’ve added different ways to configure a proxy for our Maven test runner.

    A bug preventing the "automatic expression updater" to update expressions located inside assertions has been fixed.
