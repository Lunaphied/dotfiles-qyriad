<div>
    <p>
        Many of your recent feedback was focused on how to improve the Scenario creation experience.
        In this release we’ve implemented a set of features to help you build Scenarios from different
        sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            With the new <b>Extract to scenario feature</b>, available from projects or services contextual
            menus,
            building a scenario from existing requests has never been easier.
        </li>
        <li>You can now add a bunch of requests in one go to <b>complete an existing Scenario</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Save from History</b>
            has been improved, we hope you’ll find it helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
            Last but not least, we’ve enhanced the <b>HAR import</b> to help you create Scenarios to test
            web app backends.
        </li>
    </ul>
