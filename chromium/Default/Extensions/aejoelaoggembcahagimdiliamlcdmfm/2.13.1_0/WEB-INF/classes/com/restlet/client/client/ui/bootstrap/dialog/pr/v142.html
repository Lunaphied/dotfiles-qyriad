        Dear user,
        <br/>
        First of all, thank you for using DHC! We developed DHC for many years with love to bring you the
        best tool for API testing and orchestration.
    </p>
    <p>
        A year ago DHC started its journey to become part of the Restlet’s API-First Platform.
        In the next few weeks DHC will become Restlet Client and get a new logo,
        but the tool itself won’t change, just continue to get better and listen to your feedback.
    </p>
