<p class="whats-new-intro">May 16, 2017 - Restlet Client 2.3.1</p>
<h4>Back to standards</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        Let's admit it, our plan to conquer the world with primary buttons on the left of secondary buttons
        did not bear fruits ;)
    </p>
    <p>
        We are switching back to a more standard positioning in Restlet Client dialogs.
    </p>
    <p class="img-container">
        <img alt="Back to standards" src="/images/whatsnew/back-to-standards.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope it will make your experience smoother.
