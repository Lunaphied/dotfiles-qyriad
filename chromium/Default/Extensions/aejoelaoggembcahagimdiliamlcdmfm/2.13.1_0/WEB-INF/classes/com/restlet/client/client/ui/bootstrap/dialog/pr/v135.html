    Faster, smarter cloud synchronization
</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        The synchronization takes less CPU, bandwidth and time. Working with your team also becomes
        easier since concurrent modifications are automatically merged and projects can be renamed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cloud synchronization settings are linked to your account and apply on any computer you log
        into.
