    <p>
        Some of you have started working on huge projects in Restlet Client and we are thrilled to accompany you testing
        awesome APIs.
        Unfortunately, it revealed some performance issues as projects get bigger.
        To offer you the best experience, weâ€™ve improved the overall performance and made a great leap forward!

        This version also packs a small facelift of the repository where icons have been changed to match the standard
        representation of files and folders:
    </p>
    <p class="img-container">
        <img alt="Environment overview" src="/images/whatsnew/new-icons.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, team members are now able to export content of shared drives using the contextual menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope you like it!
