    Enhance your headers
</h4>
<div>
    <div>
        <p>DHC now supports setting assertions on headers that are present <a
                href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-22" target="_blank">multiple times in the
            response</a>.
        </p>
        <p>For example, let's say that header "Cache-Control" is received as follow:</p>
        <pre>
            Cache-Control: no-cache
            Cache-Control: no-store
        </pre>
        <p>You can check that the header "Cache-Control" contains the value "no-cache" or
            "no-cache,no-store".
            As the order matters, it does not contain the value "no-store,no-cache".
        </p>

        <p>Various bug fixes and improvements have also been made across the application.</p>
