<p class="whats-new-intro">March 8, 2017 - Restlet Client 2.1.0</p>
<h4>
    <span class="whats-new-circle whats-new-item-title-circle"></span>
    Contexts are dead, long live the environments!
</h4>
<div>
    <p>We have been improving the original Context feature based on your feedback (many thanks for all of
        them by the way!). Today, we are reintroducing it as a first-class citizen in Restlet Client with a
        new name: Environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environments are available in the Requests and Scenarios tabs on the top right of your screen.
    </p>
    <p class="img-container">
        <img alt="Environment overview" src="/images/whatsnew/environment_overview.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        It gives you quicker access to select and manage your set of environment variables.
        By hovering over the eye icon you will get an overview of the variables defined in the selected
        environment.
